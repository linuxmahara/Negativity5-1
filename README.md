What is Negativity?
--------------

Negativity is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Negativity uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Negativity is also the name of the open source
software which enables the use of this currency

Negativity is intended to be an EXPERIMENTAL CHAIN utilizing mainnet for stress tests in both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake simultaneously. Please be wary that this coin may become unstable at any time

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Negativity client software, see http://www.gorillastake.com
